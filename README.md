Arduino Uno : Arduino/Genuino Uno is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P (datasheet). It has 14 digital input/output pins (of which 6 can be used as PWM outputs), 6 analog inputs, a 16 MHz quartz crystal, a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header and a reset button. It contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a USB cable or power it with a AC-to-DC adapter or battery to get started.. You can tinker with your UNO without worring too much about doing something wrong, worst case scenario you can replace the chip for a few dollars and start over again.

The bot has an access to blutooth modeule which can interact with phone via blutooth module. Based on the google text to speech api we commnuicated with bot via phone application. It'll send commands like "forward" "backward" "left" "right". Then based on the string it detected bot will act accordingly.
